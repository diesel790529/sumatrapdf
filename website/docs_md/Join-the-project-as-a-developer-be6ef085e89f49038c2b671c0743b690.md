# [Documentation](/docs/) : Join the project as a developer

SumatraPDF is an open-source, [collaborative](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/blob/master/AUTHORS) project. We always welcome new developers who want to join the project, contribute code and new features.

## Getting the sources and compiling

You'll need Visual Studio 2017 or 2015. A [free Community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) will work.

Get the sources from [https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf)

Open `vs2017/SumatraPDF.sln` or `vs2015/SumatraPDF.sln` , compile and run.

## How to join SumatraPDF project

We use a standard GitHub model:

- submit pull request
- we'll review the code, provide the feedback and merge it when it's ready

Before you start working on a significant addition, it's a good idea to first discuss it in [issue tracker](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues) .
