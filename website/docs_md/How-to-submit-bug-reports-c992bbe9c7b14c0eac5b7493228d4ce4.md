# [Documentation](/docs/) : How to submit bug reports

Did you find a bug in Sumatra? Please create a bug report in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues) .

Does it involve a specific PDF (or CHM or XPS or ...) file? It's important to provide us with a file that shows the problem by e.g. by attaching it to the issue or uploading it to [ge.tt ](http://ge.tt/) and sharing a link.

If you're using the latest release version, please try the [portable prerelease](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/prerelease.html) . It's possible the bug has already been fixed.

If the file (or other information) is confidential, you can e-mail it directly to [kkowalczyk@gmail.com](mailto:kkowalczyk@gmail.com) ( [Krzysztof Kowalczyk](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/) , Sumatra's main developer).
