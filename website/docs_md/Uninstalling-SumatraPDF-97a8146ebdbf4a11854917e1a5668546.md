# [Documentation](/docs/) : Uninstalling SumatraPDF

## Are you using official Sumatra build?

Did you download Sumatra from [official Sumatra website](http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/download-free-pdf-viewer.html) ?

If not, we can't help you because we didn't create the software you're using.

## Uninstalling Sumatra

There are 2 versions of Sumatra: an installer and a portable version (zipped executable).

## Uninstalling portable version

If you're using zipped executable, the only thing you need to do is to delete SumatraPDF.exe.

## Uninstalling the installer version

If you're using an installer version, you must have ran an installer. If you don't remember doing that then it means you didn't install a Sumatra in the first place and therefore there's nothing to do.

The installer creates the standard uninstallation shortucts so go to Control Panel, use "Uninstall a program" category. SumatraPDF should be listed there and you can double-click to uninstall it.

## What if the above doesn't help?

What if you still have questions? You can use the [forums](https://muut.com/sumatrapdf/) to ask for additional help.

However, in order for someone to help you, you need to provide the following information:

- Sumatra PDF version you're using
- your OS (Windows) version
- did you download an installer or zipped executable?
- where did you download the Sumatra from (the url of the webpage you used to download Sumatra)?
- is there SumatraPDF directory in your program files directory (usually "c:\Program Files" or "c:\Program Files (x86)" on 64-bit systems)?
- what evidence there is that Sumatra is installed? Be precise and specific. Don't just say "there's a link to it", tell us where that link is, what is the name of the link etc.

To emphasize: if you don't provide this information, we cannot help you.
