# [Documentation](/docs/) : DDE Commands

Sumatra can be controlled in a limited way from other software by sending DDE commands. They are mostly used to use SumatraPDF as a [preview tool from e.g. LaTeX editors](/docs/Use-Sumatra-as-a-pre-viewer-for-LaTeX-editors-06174d1d7be24e10966656261c70ed7f) that generate PDF files.

## Format of DDE comands

Single DDE command: `[Command(parameter1, parameter2, ..., )]` 

Multiple DDE commands: `[Command1(parameter1, parameter2, ..., )][Command2(...)][...]` 

## List of DDE commands:

- Open file
	- format: `[Open("<pdffilepath>"[,<newwindow>,<focus>,<forcerefresh>])]` 
	- arguments:
		- if `newwindow` is 1 then a new window is created even if the file is already open
		- if `focus` is 1 then the focus is set to the window
		- if `forcerefresh` is 1 the command forces the refresh of the file window if already open (useful for files opened over network that don't get file-change notifications)".
	- example: `[Open("c:\file.pdf", 1, 1, 0)]` 
- Forward-search
	- format: `[ForwardSearch(["<pdffilepath>",]"<sourcefilepath>",<line>,<column>[,<newwindow>,<setfocus>])]` 
	- arguments:
		-  `pdffilepath` : path to the PDF document (if this path is omitted and the document isn't already open, SumatraPDF won't open it for you)
		-  `column` : this parameter is for future use (just always pass 0)
		-  `newwindow` : 1 to open the document in a new window (even if the file is already opened)
		-  `focus` : 1 to set focus to SumatraPDF's window.
	- examples
		-  `[ForwardSearch("c:\file.pdf","c:\folder\source.tex",298,0)]` 
		-  `[ForwardSearch("c:\folder\source.tex",298,0,0,1)]` 
- Jump to named destination command
	- format: `[GotoNamedDest("<pdffilepath>","<destination name>")]` 
	- example: `[GotoNamedDest("c:\file.pdf", "chapter.1")]` 
	- note: the pdf file must be already opened
- Go to page
	- format: `[GotoPage("<pdffilepath>",<page number>)]` 
	- example: `[GotoPage("c:\file.pdf", 37)]` 
	- note: the pdf file must be already opened.
- Set view settings
	- format: `[SetView("<pdffilepath>","<view mode>",<zoom level>[,<scrollX>,<scrollY>])]` 
	- arguments:
		-  `view mode` :
			- "single page"
			- "facing"
			- "book view"
			- "continuous"
			- "continuous facing"
			- "continuous book view"
		-  `zoom level ` : either a zoom factor between 8 and 6400 (in percent) or one of -1 (Fit Page), -2 (Fit Width) or -3 (Fit Content)
		-  `scrollX, scrollY` : PDF document (user) coordinates of the point to be visible in the top-left of the window
	- example: `[SetView("c:\file.pdf","continuous",-3)]` 
	- note: the pdf file must already be opened
