				<h1><a href="/docs/">Documentation</a> : Why only Windows?</h1>

<p>People sometimes suggest that Sumatra should be available for some other operating system: Linux, Mac, Android etc.</p>

<p>This won&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<p>The first reason is that current developers don&rsquo;t know how to write software for those other platforms.</p>

<p>Second reason is that it would mean writing the whole program from scratch for a new platform.</p>

<p>Sumatra is tightly integrated with and optimized for Windows. Making a version for another operating system is not a matter of making a few changes here and there but writing all the UI code from scratch i.e. redoing years of development that went into Sumatra.</p>

<p>SumatraPDF is an open-source project so anyone is free to take our source code and use as much of it as they want to create equivalent for some other operating system, but we&rsquo;re unlikely to do it ourselves.</p>
